# Digital Identity Claimed Identity Collector

# di-ipv-cri-cic-front

Frontend for the Claimed Identity Collector

This is the home for the front end user interface for a credential issuer as a part of the Identity Proofing and Verification (IPV) system within the GDS digital identity platform. Other repositories are used for core services or other credential issuers.

# Installation

Clone this repository and then run

```bash
yarn install
```

## Environment Variables

- 'BASE_URL': Externally accessible base url of the webserver. Used to generate the callback url as part of credential issuer oauth flows
- `IPV_STUB_URL`: Mocks being sent to/from IPV Core to enable browser testing
- `PORT` - Default port to run webserver on. (Default to `5020`)

# Deployment in own stack in DEV

To deploy a copy of the frontend infra from a local branch as a separate isolated stack in DEV:

- update the `Image:` tag in template.yaml to point to the container image to be deployed - this can be found by looking in ECR in the AWS Console for the latest image and tag.
- the run:

```shell
sam build --parallel --no-cached
sam deploy --resolve-s3 --stack-name "CUSTOM_STACK_NAME" --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --confirm-changeset --parameter-overrides \
"Environment=\"dev\" PermissionsBoundary=\"none\" VpcStackName=\"vpc-cri\" EnableScalingInDev=0"
```

Note the following parameters can be used to specify whether or not to deploy the autoscaling infra:

- `EnableScalingInDev` default to 0 which inhibits deployment of scaling infra in dev; set to 1 to deploy scaling infra
- `MinContainerCount` default is 3
- `MaxContainerCount` default is 12

# Mock Data

[Wiremock](https://wiremock.org/) has been used to create a [stateful mock](https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/) of the API, through the use of scenarios. These configuration files are stored as JSON files in the [./test/mocks/mappings](./test/mocks/mappings) directory.

This can be run by using:

`yarn run mock`

The frontend can be configured to use this mock server through two environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV = development` - this enables a middleware that passes the `x-scenario-id` header from web requests through to the API
- `API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:8090` - this points the frontend at the Wiremock instance

A browser extension, such as [Mod Header](https://modheader.com/), can be used to set the value of this header in a web browser.

# Request properties

In order to support consistent use of headers for API requests, [middleware](./src/lib/axios) is applied to add an instance of
[axios](https://axios-http.com/) on each request onto `req.axios`. This is then reused in any code that uses the API.

# Browser tests

Browser based tests can be run against the mock server, and should be able to be run against an instance of the API.

These tests are written using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/javascript/) as the test runner and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as the automation tool. They also follow the [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-pom) for separation of concerns.

They can be run by using:

`yarn run test:browser`

## Using mocked scenario data

Any cucumber feature or scenario with a tag prefixed with `@mock-api:`

e.g.
```
  @mock-api:question-error
  Scenario: API error
...
```

This scenario will be configured to send a `scenario-id` header of `question-error` on every web browser request.

### Code Owners

This repo has a `CODEOWNERS` file in the root and is configured to require PRs to reviewed by Code Owners.

## Create and upload a custom image to ECR

Execute the following commands to create a custom image locally and push it up to ECR.
You need to have AWS credentials in your shell via `aws-vault` or `gds-cli` or similar.
`YOUR_REPO` needs to refer to an existing repo in ECR, you can create one in console if you don't have one already.

```shell
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t di-ipv-cri-cic-front .
docker tag di-ipv-cri-cic-front:latest 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev-images-ddunford
docker push 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev-images-ddunford
```

Then to use this new image update the `Image:` tag in the template.yaml and redeploy your template locally in to your own stack in DEV.
